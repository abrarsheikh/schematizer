This module implements Avro schema resolution based on the resolution rules:
http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html#Schema+Resolution

It also contains Avro schema validator which checks if a writer schema is
compatible with a reader schema.

Note that Python Avro library also has schema resolution function
`avro.io.DatumReader.match_schemas`, but it is missing some of the resolution
rules. Therefore, a separate SchemaResolution class is implemented here.
